bookBerry is a simple tool to help organize your books.

## Usage

[Visit bookBerry here](https://am-hernandez.github.io/bookBerry/) to begin organizing your library into a single file.\
Fill out each field and then click the **add book to library** button at the end of the form to add this book to your file. The form will refresh and you may add another book. Add as many as you need!\
After adding a book to your library, the button **download your library!** will appear to allow you to save your library as a JSON file.

## Roadmap(work in progress)

This application is still in the process of being constructed. Here's what's in the pipeline:

- present option to download file (disable auto download on click)
- open file in new browser tab for copy+paste.
- create aside to view library in same window as it is being populated (bookshelf).
